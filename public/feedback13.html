                  <p>Thank you very much for organizing such a very useful session for us. I gained much valuable knowledge, which were out of my expectations. All parts of the session were informative and were presented attractively. First of all, because you invited attendants to make questions in advance so most questions in the first part covered what we want to know about SEO and the internship. Secondly, the tips for interview and application were practical. For example, I can know how to make an impressive introduction about myself in the interview by telling a story and how to use action verb to write CV in one page  effectively. Last but not least, I really impressed by the SEO alumni’s enthusiasm. Not only did you provide us with valuable information but you motivated us to improve ourselves comprehensively.</p>

This session did not only give me more insights about SEO, but also made me think alot about the person I am and the person I want to be in the future. </p>

                  <p>Interview simulation</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>the instruction to write a good resume and chances to SEO</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>The resume tips are very useful to me write a perfect resume that can present me clearly and professionally to employers. I also like the part when I was  one of three students who volunteer to answer interview questions and then received feedbacks from chi Hanh. These feedbacks are very constructive that can help me to improve my interview performance in the future. </p>
 <hr>
                  <p>Interview presentation</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>I find the part of instructions for CV writing and interviewing tips really really interesting and useful, not only in applying for SEO but also in our latter career. </p>

                  <p>Sessions should be longer</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>The first part should be more consice and interactive if possible :D</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>There should be more slots for individual CV comment.</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>More Q&amp;A time and speak slowly</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>Speaker should slower their voices and prepare more carefully about examples. Besides, alumni in charge of one - on - one resume critique should read through resumes in advance to give more insight feedback.</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>In resume feedback session, SEO faci should allocate people into each group and care members of the group so that everyone can listen and learn from their shared advice and experience. 
Q&amp;A should be prepared better. And instead of answering the questions prepared before, the Organizing Committee should take time for the direct questions from the students that time. </p>
 <hr>
                  <p>Well, you need to magnify all the slides showing the sample resume so that everybody can see clearly, cut out the resume to some separate smaller sections than advise on each so that everybody can picture in the most specific way how each section should be written. Also, next time please don&#39;t turn off every light but spare some light in the middle and at the back of the conference room so that we the audience can take notes in a convenient way :)</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>Better PR campaign so that more students can join</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>I think the seminar yesterday was very useful and informative. However, I think it would be better if you can deliver it in English or in Vietnamese purely. The speech with mixed English-Vietnamese seemed quite hard for me to get it fully. </p>
 <hr>
                  <p>Time management. But i don&#39;t think it is a big deal. As long as the audiences are engaged to the speaker, which is exactly what happened yesterday, it is okay.</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>SEO might choose a larger venue, and invite more students.
Better time management. Some sessions were longer than expected, am I right?</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>Punctuality. 30&#39; minute late is too much.</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>More interactive</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>N/A</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>Time. Yesterday, the session was so interesting but time was so long. So in future sessions, time should be shorter.</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>More audience engagement
More trial
Prepare better for presentation</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>should spend more time on helping candidates check their resume</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>Facilities: light, projector
Slide in Resume Tips: needed to be clearer 
At the end of information session, each guest speaker can be in charge of one sub group, in which they will share their career path and impact of SEO on them. </p>
 <hr>
                  <p>Beginning time</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>Start on time</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>There should be a trial interview on the session, so that we could know the format of the interview.</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>there should be more people let to know about this event and take part in, the Info session was great and there should not be so many people missing it^^</p>
 <hr>
                  <ol>
<li>More interactive game^^</li>
<li>And can you send me the contact list (only email is ok) of all the speakers? I didn&#39;t remember all of them, and moreover I want to send some of them some questions, is it ok?</li>
</ol>
 <hr>
                  <p>The Q&amp;A part could be better if the speakers paid more attention to questions.
Tentative time for the whole event should be longer than 2 hours.</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>I think the session should start on time and it will be better if you can comment on some CVs in front of all attendants rather than only comment CV personally for some people.</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>Maybe time management... </p>
 <hr>
                  <p>professional image could be enhaced by on time performance</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>I wanna listen to SEO alumni sharing more stories of their internship experiences as well as providing more information of SEO&#39;s partner companies and positions offered.</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>It should be organised in earlier time. I could suggest 9am</p>
 <hr>
                  <ul>
<li>time management</li>
</ul>
 <hr>
                  <p>timing - I wish it was longer, indeed.</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>More interactions between presenters &amp; audiences</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>time should be prolonged</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>Better time management. In the event, sometimes the presenter got into a rush. </p>
 <hr>
                  <ul>
<li>It would be better if you can organize longer sessions</li>
</ul>
 <hr>
                  <p>Timimg
+The session should start and finish on time
+The speaker should talk more slowly</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>Some slides are hard to read, which maybe due to the projector</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>I would like to be informed about the interview part to better prepare before going to the conference.</p>
 <hr>
                  <ul>
<li>Venue should not be that big </li>
<li>Timeline needs to be  stricter</li>
</ul>
 <hr>
                  <p>The speed in speaking of the presenter should be a little slower for everyone to follow</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>It would be better if the info session started 1 hour earlier so the presenter will not be hurry to cover all information in such a short time.</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>The session can be longer so that the speakers are able to talk slowly and more detail. I think all of participants will be willing to sit one more hour for this very interesting seminar. </p>
 <hr>
                  <p>Extending time</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>The session should start on schedule :)</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>More time to network with SEO alumni</p>
 <hr>
                  <ul>
<li>give everything thoroughly and carefully and slowly</li>
</ul>
 <hr>
                  <p>Time management and audience reaction are should be improved.</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>visual effect</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>_Timing: with the content and the way to deliver like this, the time should be extended for attendee&#39;s time expectation and arrangement
_Space: RMIT seems to be small for the big number of attendees and the last rows find hard to see slides</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>Have more time in all the sections so that the audiences can interact with each others and with the speakers, alumni...</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>There are two things I think you guys should care more about. First, it&#39;s the time. Please stick to your schedule. I know that it&#39;s hard to convey so many things in such a short 2-hour session and in fact the session lasted longer than you had expected, so just lengthen the allotted time in future sessions so that attendees can prepare about it. Honestly, if it had not been such an amazing and interesting session, I would have left it because I also had an important plan after that. The second thing is that the resume assessment between peers were not really effective. I sat next to a stranger. He didn&#39;t want to share his resume with me and neither did I.</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>time</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>The time should be increased to further interact between members and students</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>Time of event: I think the sessions you gave were necessary and all welcomed by the students so it maybe better to set an amount of time that fixes your contents to make things run not too hurriedly like that.</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>The session could start more punctually and the seat arrangement could be done differently in order to promote the interaction between participants more effectively. Since we have plenty of ex-SEO members, each could form a small group and &#39;&#39;inspect&#39;&#39; one sample CV of a group member and then have direct Q &amp; A from members of the group. This could involve more people in to the &#39;&#39;CV Clinic&#39;&#39;, since many was left out on the day. </p>
 <hr>
                  <ol>
<li>More detail venue address</li>
<li>Better timing control</li>
<li>Provide or public ageda for attendant at the begining of the session</li>
</ol>
 <hr>
                  <p>the PR should be improved (cuz few students are informed about this show</p>
 <hr>
                  <ol>
<li>Sessions should be longer and more details. Some parts of the presentation went too fast. </li>
</ol>
 <hr>
                  <ul>
<li>Each session should be started on time so the speaker has enough time to present their slides</li>
</ul>
 <hr>
                  <p>I think the one thing that you should improve in your future sessions is that the time allowed for each part of your event must be fixed, which is to prevent the prolongation of time as in this info session. </p>
 <hr>
                  <p>U should give us the agenda of the seminar in advance.</p>

I will do my best for the application.
I love u :x</p>

                   <hr>
                  <p>Besides the professional expression, I also find the organizing committee people quite funny and friendly. 
The content of the information session is really helpful to fulfill our vision of the SEO program and improve our knowledge of recruiting process.
I&#39;m impressed with Ms. Hanh accent and her inspiring presentation.</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>I attended the SEO Seminar- Info Session organized by SEO today, and it left strong impression on me, definitely. I was so much informed, thanks to which I realized some surprising other things. Anyone who missed this event at FTU for any reason please try to attend the same Info Session scheduled in the next 3 days at RMIT. I have only one thing to tell you: You would not regret coming there.</p>
 <hr>
                   <hr>
                   <hr>
                  <p>it is great. Truthfully, I don&#39;t go to the information session or the workshop much but with after this session, I think I need to change my mind about it. It was absolutely wonderful, every single minute of it</p>
 <hr>
                   <hr>
                   <hr>

                   <hr>
                  <p>I like it when there are 2 consultants from BCG and Bain who are SEO alumni joining and consulting us! All the speakers had a sense of humor and made the info session very enjoyable.</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>After the session at FTU, I encouraged many friends of mine to go to your session at RMIT because I am sure they will achieve many precious things like I did. I hope you will organize successfully many practical events in the future.</p>
 <hr>
                   <hr>
                  <p>I were impressed that the session of small scale was even more intriguing and professional than those of some other companies held in FTU</p>
 <hr>
                   <hr>

Because the speaker talks too fast for me to remember or take notes.</p>
 <hr>
                   <hr>
                   <hr>
                  <p>Thank you so much SEO Vietnam for holding the information seminar in Hanoi. As its name, the seminar was very informative and helpful for us. This is the chance for us to not only get experience of CV writing, interview but also get closer to SEO organization and alumni.</p>

<p>Once again, many thanks for that!</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>Good</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>The info session at RMIT University was so informative and inspiring, providing me with more insights into the program and encouraging me to start this journey with SEO again this year. I really love the sense of family shared among SEO alumni as well as the way you have engaged the audiences in the info session. I really hope to meet you again some day as a member of SEO too. </p>
 <hr>
                  <p>Before going to this info session, I imagined it would be formal and so serious. The fact is members of SEO were friendly, enthusiastic and humorous more than I expected and this seminar encouraged me a lot to apply this prestigious program.</p>
 <hr>
                   <hr>
                   <hr>
                   <hr>
                  <p>good job!</p>
 <hr>
                   <hr>
                   <hr>
                  <p>At first, when I know about SEO, I just see as the chance for internship but when I attended your seminar, the bottom reasons revived in me, because of you guys, your friendly support, your enthusiasm for us being better and your &quot;living is sharing&quot;.</p>

<p>Btw, I have just followed SEO webminar. Some thoughts:
 When you promote the webminar, it&#39;s better to remind audience to spend time reading your FAQ avoiding overlapped questions
Should we have a secretary to note the key points of answers in the typing box so that the late comers do not miss and ask again?</p>

<p>Again, thank you for all useful information, such an innovative way for high interaction. See you tomorrow!</p>
 <hr>
                   <hr>
                   <hr>
                   <hr>
                  <p>This is one of the most useful seminars I&#39;ve attended</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>Thank you! You did it good.
Useful, friendly and enthusiastically.
I&#39;m in hope to be a member of SEO-V.</p>
 <hr>
                  <p>Before coming to the SEO-IIV information session, I was imagining just an ordinary career fair with people lining up for email, job descriptions and company contacts. Instead, I found a group of young people leading the session who are proud of who they are, passionate about what they believe in if that alone was not enough, they inspired me to be a better version of myself. And if someone ask what my first experience with SEO was, my answer would simply be: &quot;You wouldn&#39;t know, you weren&#39;t there!&quot; </p>
 <hr>
                  <p>Overall, I satisfy with the information session organised by SEO-Vietnam. I can deeply understand more about SEO-Vietnam and find lots of useful information.
Thank SEO-Vietnam</p>
 <hr>
                   <hr>
                  <p>This is the first time I have joined a event of SEO-Vietnam. What impressed me the most is the enthusiasm of all the alumnus. They were really willing to share their experiences and gave a lot of useful advices for students during and after the sessions. I really hope to have chances to be engaged in more events of SEO-Vietnam in the future.</p>
 <hr>
                   <hr>
                  <p>Thank you very much for your info session, which is not just a session for SEO applicants only, but it is also an event that really helped to motivate my passion, promote my youth spirit and encourage my determination to overcome my upcoming obstacles. 
Really hope to have a chance to be on board with you next time! </p>
